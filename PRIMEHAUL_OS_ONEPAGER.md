## AI-Powered Instant Quotes for UK Removal Companies

## THE PROBLEM

**UK removal companies lose 30% of jobs because they're too slow.**

- **4-24 hour response times** → Customers book with faster competitors
- **£200-500 per site visit** → Wasted on quotes that don't convert
- **Manual inventory counting** → Error-prone, time-consuming
- **No mobile tools** → Bosses can't approve quotes on the go

**Result:** Slow response = lost revenue. Traditional quoting is broken.
