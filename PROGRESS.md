## Session Log: 23 February 2026 (Continued)

### Video Ads Shortened — 100s → 59s

**Problem:** Feedback that the promo videos were too long at ~100 seconds.

**Solution:** Rewrote all 7 voiceover scripts to be more concise, regenerated audio via ElevenLabs, and compressed animation timing across all scenes.

**Script Changes:**
- S2 (Problem): Cut to two sharp sentences about wasted site visits and losing customers
- S3 (Customer Flow): Tightened to "send a link, drop a pin, snap photos, done"
- S4 (AI Magic): Focused on scan → identify → calculate, no filler
- S5 (Boss Dashboard): Streamlined to set price → approve → deposit paid
- S6 (Results): Kept punchy stats — 10x faster, 30% more jobs, zero site visits
- S7 (CTA): Unchanged — already tight

**Animation Timing Compressed:**
- Scene 2: Pain point delays (30,180,320) → (20,100,175)
- Scene 3: Screen transitions (120,280,440) → (70,160,250)
- Scene 4: Scan/accuracy/totals/quote delays all compressed ~60%
- Scene 5: Notification/card/price/approve/deposit delays all compressed ~60%

**New Durations:**
| Scene | Old | New |
|-------|-----|-----|
| S1 Intro | 4.7s | 4.7s |
| S2 Problem | 12.3s | 8.3s |
| S3 Customer Flow | 18.3s | 9.8s |
| S4 AI Magic | 23.7s | 11.7s |
| S5 Boss Dashboard | 25.3s | 12.7s |
| S6 Results | 8.7s | 6.9s |
| S7 CTA | 6.3s | 4.5s |
| **Total** | **~100s** | **~59s** |

**Renders (all 3 formats):**
- `video/out/primehaul-demo.mp4` — 1920x1080, 6.1 MB
- `video/out/primehaul-tiktok.mp4` — 1080x1920, 6.2 MB
- `video/out/primehaul-square.mp4` — 1080x1080, 5.9 MB

**Files Modified:**
- `video/generate-audio.js` — Shorter scripts for all 7 scenes
- `video/public/s1-s7.mp3` — Regenerated audio files
- `video/src/helpers/timing.ts` — Updated durations (1760 frames ≈ 58.7s)
- `video/src/scenes/Scene2Problem.tsx` — Compressed pain point delays
- `video/src/scenes/Scene3CustomerFlow.tsx` — Compressed screen transitions
- `video/src/scenes/Scene4AImagic.tsx` — Compressed all animation delays

## Session Log: 23 February 2026

### Quote Approval Email Notification

**Feature:** When the boss approves a quote (standard or quick-approve), the customer now receives a professional HTML email with their approved price and a link to book.

**Email Contents:**
- "Your Quote is Ready" header with company branding
- Prominent approved price in green (£X,XXX.XX)
- Move summary (collection → delivery addresses)
- "View Quote & Book" CTA button
- Company name and phone in footer
- Plain text fallback included

**Integration Points:**
- Standard approval endpoint (`/{slug}/admin/job/{token}/approve`)
- Quick approval endpoint (`/{slug}/admin/job/{token}/quick-approve`)
- Only sends if customer has an email address
- Wrapped in try/except — email failure never blocks approval

### Per-Company Email Sending (Two-Tier System)

**Problem:** All emails were sent from PrimeHaul's SMTP account. Bosses wanted emails to come from their own company email address.

**Solution — Two tiers:**

**Tier 1 (Default, no setup):** Emails sent as *"Smith Removals via PrimeHaul"* from `noreply@primehaul.co.uk` with Reply-To set to the company's email. Customer replies go directly to the company.

**Tier 2 (Company SMTP):** Boss configures their own SMTP credentials in Company Details settings. Emails then send directly from their own email address (e.g. `info@smithremovals.co.uk`).

**Settings UI (Company Details page):**
- SMTP Server + Port fields (grid layout)
- Email/Username field
- Password field (with Gmail App Password link)
- Optional From Email override
- "Send Test Email" button (sends to company's contact email)
- Status badges: green check when configured, yellow warning when not
- Collapsible "Common email provider settings" cheat sheet (Gmail, Outlook, Yahoo, Zoho)

**Technical Changes:**
- `send_email()` accepts optional `smtp_config` dict — uses company SMTP when provided, falls back to PrimeHaul default
- `send_quote_approved_email()` routes through company SMTP or falls back to "via PrimeHaul" branding
- Both approval endpoints build SMTP config from company model fields

### Database Migration

| Migration | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| `fix014_company_smtp_settings.py` | Add `smtp_host`, `smtp_port`, `smtp_username`, `smtp_password`, `smtp_from_email` to companies |

### Files Created

- `alembic/versions/fix014_company_smtp_settings.py` — SMTP columns migration

### Files Modified

- `app/models.py` — 5 new SMTP columns on Company model
- `app/notifications.py` — New `send_quote_approved_email()` function, `send_email()` updated with `from_name`, `reply_to`, `smtp_config` params
- `app/main.py` — Email send in both approval endpoints, 2 new SMTP endpoints (save + test), updated company details GET with SMTP query params
- `app/templates/admin_company_details.html` — New "Email Settings" section with full SMTP config UI

### Commits

## Session Log: 22 February 2026

### PrimeHaul Promotional Video Ad

Built a full animated video ad using **Remotion** (React-based video framework) with AI voiceover via **ElevenLabs**.

**Video Structure — 7 Scenes (~100 seconds):**
1. **Intro** — Logo + "Stop Quoting Blind. Start Quoting Smart."
2. **The Problem** — Wasted site visits, slow quotes, lost jobs
3. **Customer Flow** — Phone mockup: link → pin drop → photos → done
4. **AI Magic** — AI scanning photos, detecting items with CBM/weight
5. **Boss Dashboard** — Survey notification, job card, price setting, deposit
6. **Results** — Animated stats (10x faster, 30% more jobs, 0 site visits)
7. **CTA** — Free trial, primehaul.co.uk, "Built by djam.ai"

**Voice:** George (British male) on ElevenLabs Turbo v2.5 model — energetic, natural UK accent with low stability/high style for expressiveness.

**Three Formats Rendered:**
- `video/out/primehaul-demo.mp4` — 1920x1080 (YouTube/website) — 8.8 MB
- `video/out/primehaul-tiktok.mp4` — 1080x1920 (TikTok/Reels) — 8.8 MB
- `video/out/primehaul-square.mp4` — 1080x1080 (Instagram/Facebook) — 8.5 MB

**Tech Stack:**
- Remotion 4.0.242 for animation/rendering
- ElevenLabs API for TTS voiceover (George voice, turbo_v2_5 model)
- 7 React scene components with spring animations, typewriter effects, phone mockups
- `generate-audio.js` script for bulk audio generation

**Key Files:**
| What | File |
|------|------|
| Main composition | `video/src/PrimeHaulDemo.tsx` |
| Scene components | `video/src/scenes/Scene1-7*.tsx` |
| Timing config | `video/src/helpers/timing.ts` |
| Audio generator | `video/generate-audio.js` |

## Session Log: 13 February 2026

### Go-Live Preparation with Rick

Working with business partner Rick to prepare for public launch. Major UX polish, accessibility features, and infrastructure setup.

### Delivery Property Type Added

**Problem:** Survey only asked about collection property type, not delivery location.

**Solution:**
- Added `dropoff_property_type` column to jobs table
- New `/dropoff-property` step in survey flow after pickup property type
- Options: House, Bungalow, Flat, Office, Storage
- Added "Bungalow" option to collection property types too
- Quote preview and admin job review now show both property types

### Photo Display Bug Fixed

**Problem:** Room scan photos stuck on "Analysing" and showed blank boxes instead of actual photos.

**Root Cause:** Photo URLs pointed to `/static/uploads/...` but files were stored in `uploads/` and served via `/photo/...` endpoint.

**Solution:**
- Fixed photo URLs to use correct `/photo/{company_id}/{token}/{filename}` endpoint
- Added instant photo preview using FileReader API (shows photo immediately while AI processes)
- Added processing overlay with spinner on photos during AI analysis
- Two-phase progress: "Uploading" → "AI Analyzing"
- Better success messages showing item count

### Access Details Validation UX

**Problem:** Customers couldn't proceed from parking/details page but didn't know what was missing.

**Solution:**
- Added clear validation error banner listing exactly which fields are missing
- Red highlighting on incomplete fields (lift radio buttons, parking dropdown)
- Auto-scroll to first error
- Real-time error clearing when user fills in field
- Shake animation on error banner to draw attention

### Quote Acceptance Price Fix

**Problem:** Quote acceptance page showed estimate range (£350-£450) instead of final price after admin approved.

**Solution:** Now shows single final price (£400) with "Final price confirmed" label when `job.final_quote_price` is set.

### Mobile Header Overflow Fixed

**Problem:** On mobile, "An intelligent move." tagline pushed "Get 3 Free Credits" button off screen.

**Solution:** Hide tagline on mobile (<768px), reduce header padding/font sizes.

### Landing Page Copy Updates

Updated to reflect credit-based pricing model:
- "What if I don't like it?" FAQ → explains credits model, no subscription
- "14-Day Trial" → "Get 3 Free Credits"
- "Cancel anytime" → "No subscription • Credits never expire"
- Added ICO registration to data security FAQ

### Light/Dark Mode Toggle

**Feature:** Full theme switching for both customer survey and admin dashboard.

**Implementation:**
- CSS custom properties for both themes (dark default, light mode via `.light-mode` class)
- 🌙/☀️ toggle button in nav header
- Defaults to system preference (`prefers-color-scheme`)
- Persists to localStorage (separate keys for survey vs admin)
- Smooth color transitions
- Updates mobile browser chrome color

**Light Mode Colors:**
- Background: #f5f5f7 (clean light gray)
- Cards: #ffffff (white)
- Text: #1d1d1f (dark gray)
- Green accent adjusted for contrast

### Voice Guidance (Accessibility)

**Feature:** Optional voice guide that reads instructions aloud on each survey page - "granny proof" for less tech-savvy users.

**Implementation:**
- Friendly opt-in card on first visit: "Need a helping hand?"
- "Voice ON" green pill toggle in header (easy to spot and control)
- Uses **OpenAI TTS** with "nova" voice (natural, human-like)
- Server-side caching (`tts_cache/`) for fast repeat plays
- Remembers preference in localStorage
- Every survey page has custom voice prompt

**ALL Survey Pages with Voice Guidance:**
| Page | Message Summary |
|------|-----------------|
| Start | "Welcome! Enter your addresses and choose property types..." |
| Property Type | "What type of property are we collecting from?..." |
| Dropoff Property | "What type of property are we delivering to?..." |
| Access Details | "Tell us about floors, lifts, and parking..." |
| Move Date | "When would you like to move?..." |
| Move Map | "Let's set your moving locations..." |
| Room Selection | "Tap on each room that has items..." |
| Room Scan | "Tap Take Photos and point your camera..." |
| Photos Bulk | "Time to photograph your home..." |
| Review Inventory | "Quick check before your quote..." |
| Quote Preview | Different messages for pending/awaiting/approved status |
| Quote Acceptance | "Tick the checkbox and tap Accept Quote..." |

### Email Setup Guide

Created comprehensive email templates and outreach documentation for Rick:
- 4-email sequence with timing (Day 1 → Day 3 → Day 8 → Day 15)
- Initial contact + 3 follow-up templates
- Reply templates for common responses
- Subject line A/B testing ideas
- Where to find leads (Checkatrade, Yell, LinkedIn, etc.)
- Tracking spreadsheet structure
- GDPR compliance notes

### Infrastructure

- Google Workspace domain verified
- Email aliases configured (sales@, privacy@ → Rick, support@, hello@ → Jaybo)
- ICO registration complete

### Alembic Migration Chain Fixed

**Problem:** Deployment failed due to conflicting migration revisions.

**Fix:**
- Renamed `fix010_dropoff_property_type.py` to `fix011_dropoff_property_type.py`
- Updated `down_revision` from `fix009` to `fix010_outreach`
- Fixed `fix010_outreach` to reference `fix009` (not `fix009_final_quote_price`)

### Files Created

- `app/templates/dropoff_property_type.html` — Delivery property type selection
- `/Users/primehaul/Desktop/PRIMEHAUL_EMAIL_TEMPLATES.md` — Outreach templates for Rick
- `/Users/primehaul/Desktop/RICK_GO_LIVE_TASKS.md` — Rick's go-live checklist
- `GO_LIVE_CHECKLIST.md` — Comprehensive launch checklist

### Files Modified

- `app/templates/quote_acceptance.html` — Final price display, voice guidance
- `app/templates/landing_primehaul_uk.html` — Mobile header fix, copy updates, ICO

### Voice Guide Overhaul

**Problem:** Voice guidance existed but wasn't being triggered, and the small speaker icon in the header was too subtle for users to notice. Users wanted something "super intuitive" for less tech-savvy customers.

**Solution:**

1. **Friendly Opt-In Card at Start**
   - New pulsing green card appears on first visit: "Need a helping hand?"
   - Two clear buttons: "Yes, guide me" / "No thanks"
   - Only shows once (remembered via localStorage)
   - When enabled, speaks a welcoming intro and starts guiding

2. **Improved Header Toggle**
   - Redesigned from small icon to visible pill button
   - Shows "Voice" when off, "ON" (green) when active
   - Green border/background when voice is enabled
   - Tapping immediately speaks current page guidance

3. **All Survey Pages Now Have Guidance**
   - Added voice to 4 missing templates:
     - `move_date.html`: "When would you like to move?..."
     - `move_map.html`: "Let's set your moving locations..."
     - `photos_bulk.html`: "Time to photograph your home..."
     - `review_inventory.html`: "Quick check before your quote..."

4. **Voice Quality Upgrade (OpenAI TTS)**
   - Changed from robotic browser TTS to OpenAI's "nova" voice
   - Natural, friendly, human-like speech
   - Server-side caching (`tts_cache/`) for performance
   - Works via `/api/speak` POST endpoint

**Files Modified:**
- `app/templates/start_v2.html` — Voice opt-in card + CSS
- `app/templates/base.html` — New voice toggle UI + JS
- `app/static/app.css` — Voice toggle pill styles
- `app/templates/move_date.html` — Added voice guidance
- `app/templates/move_map.html` — Added voice guidance
- `app/templates/photos_bulk.html` — Added voice guidance
- `app/templates/review_inventory.html` — Added voice guidance

## Session Log: 6 February 2026

### Prepaid Credits System

**Problem:** Pay-per-survey billing (£9.99 charged after each survey) created friction and unpredictable costs for removal companies.

**Solution:** Replaced with prepaid credit packs that companies buy upfront:

| Pack | Credits | Price | Per Survey |
|------|---------|-------|------------|
| Starter | 10 | £99 | £9.90 |
| Growth | 25 | £225 | £9.00 |
| Pro | 50 | £399 | £7.98 |
| Enterprise | 100 | £699 | £6.99 |

- 3 free credits on signup (replaces 14-day trial)
- Credits deducted when survey is submitted
- Low credits warning banner when < 3 remaining
- Buy credits page with Stripe Checkout integration

### Final Quote Price

**Problem:** Boss could only approve a price range (£500-£650), but customers expected a single fixed quote.

**Solution:** When boss clicks "Approve", a modal appears asking for the final fixed price. AI suggests the midpoint as default. The final price replaces the estimate range on the customer's quote.

- New `final_quote_price` column on Job model
- Modal with AI-suggested default
- Quote preview shows single price when approved

### Activity Tracking System

**Purpose:** Monitor boss behavior during beta testing to collect product insights and lay foundation for self-evolving AI system.

**What's Tracked:**
- Page views with time spent
- Button clicks and interactions (link generated, copied, shared)
- Feature usage patterns
- Friction points (rage clicks, long pauses, errors)
- Session flows (user journeys)

**New Module:** `app/activity_tracker.py`
- `track_activity()` — Core tracking function
- `track_boss_action()` — Boss-specific events
- `track_customer_action()` — Customer survey events
- `track_friction()` — UX friction points
- `get_live_boss_activity()` — Real-time feed for superadmin
- `get_funnel_analytics()` — Survey drop-off rates
- `get_friction_hotspots()` — Pages with most friction
- `analyze_patterns_and_suggest()` — AI-powered UX suggestions

**New Superadmin Activity Dashboard:** `/superadmin/activity`
- **Live Feed** tab — Real-time boss activity (auto-refreshes every 30s)
- **AI Insights** tab — Detected issues with severity levels
- **Funnel** tab — Survey conversion rates with drop-off visualization
- **Engagement** tab — Company engagement rankings

### Glowing Packing CTA (Improved)

**Change:** The packing service upsell was in a collapsed `<details>` dropdown. Now it's an always-visible card with:
- Breathing green glow animation (`glowPulse`)
- Prominent header with 📦 icon
- "From +£X" pricing
- Larger checkboxes (20x20px) for easier mobile tapping
- "Professional packing service — all materials included" footer

### Variant Toggle — Ordering Fix

**Bug:** Item indices mismatched between room scan view and update-variant endpoint because they used different ordering.

**Fix:** Both now use `order_by(Item.id)` for consistent indexing.

### Private Sales Automation Dashboard

**Feature:** Fully automated lead outreach system at `/sales` (password protected).

**What It Does:**
1. **Auto-scrape leads** — Import from CSV or use built-in scraper
2. **Send cold emails** — 3-email sequence (initial + 2 follow-ups)
3. **Read replies** — Checks inbox via IMAP
4. **Analyze sentiment** — Detects positive/negative/question
5. **Auto-reply** — Sends appropriate response based on sentiment
6. **Track pipeline** — New → Contacted → Replied → Interested → Signed Up

**Email Sequence:**
- Day 0: Initial email ("Quick question about your quoting process")
- Day 3: Follow-up 1 ("Just bumping this...")
- Day 7: Follow-up 2 ("Last one from me")

**Files:**
- `app/outreach.py` — Core automation logic, email templates, IMAP/SMTP
- `app/templates/sales_dashboard.html` — Private dashboard UI
- `app/main.py` — Routes at `/sales/*`
- `scripts/run_sales_automation.py` — Cron job script
- `scripts/scrape_leads.py` — Lead scraper for Checkatrade/Yell

**Environment Variables:**
- `SALES_PASSWORD` — Dashboard password (default: primesales2026)
- `SALES_AUTOMATION` — Set to "true" to enable auto-sending
- `SMTP_USER` / `SMTP_PASSWORD` — For sending emails
- `IMAP_HOST` / `IMAP_PORT` — For reading replies (default: Gmail)

**Access:** `https://app.primehaul.co.uk/sales`

### Email Survey Invitations

**Feature:** Bosses can now send survey links directly to customers via email from the dashboard.

**How It Works:**
1. Boss generates a survey link on the dashboard
2. Enters customer name (optional) and email
3. Clicks "Send Invite"
4. Customer receives a beautifully formatted HTML email with:
   - "Get Your Free Removal Quote" header
   - Big green CTA button to start survey
   - "How It Works" 3-step guide
   - "Why Choose Us?" benefits section
   - Company branding

**Files:**
- `app/notifications.py` — Added `send_survey_invitation()` function
- `app/main.py` — Added `/admin/send-survey-invite` POST endpoint
- `app/templates/admin_dashboard_v2.html` — Added email input UI + `sendEmailInvite()` JS

**Analytics:** Invite sends tracked as `survey_invite_sent` events for analytics.

## Session Log: 5 February 2026

### Self-Learning ML System

**Purpose:** The system now learns from user corrections and automatically improves future AI detections. The more it's used, the smarter it gets.

**How It Works:**
1. Users correct AI detections (e.g., "Large Couch" → "3-seater sofa")
2. Corrections stored in `ItemFeedback` table
3. System analyzes patterns — when 70%+ of corrections match, pattern is learned
4. **AI Prompt Evolution** — Learned patterns injected into GPT-4 prompt, improving base detections
5. **Post-Processing** — Results double-checked against learned patterns
6. **Dimension Learning** — System averages corrected dimensions and applies them
7. Learning cycle runs after each survey submission + can be triggered manually

**Two-Layer Intelligence:**
- Layer 1: AI prompt enhanced with learned naming conventions and dimensions
- Layer 2: Output corrections applied based on confidence thresholds

**New Database Table:**
- `learned_corrections` — stores learned patterns with confidence scores

**New Module:**
- `app/ml_learning.py` — pattern detection, confidence calculation, auto-apply logic

**Integration Points:**
- Photo upload (3 locations) — applies learned corrections to AI results
- Survey submission — triggers learning cycle
- Superadmin dashboard — shows feedback details and link to learning page

**Superadmin Learning Page (`/superadmin/learning`):**
- View all learned patterns with confidence bars
- See which patterns are auto-applied vs still learning
- Manual "Run Learning Cycle" button
- Explanation of how the system learns

**Files Created:**
- `app/ml_learning.py` — Self-learning module
- `app/templates/superadmin_learning.html` — Learning dashboard
- `alembic/versions/fix007_learned_corrections.py` — Migration

**Files Modified:**
- `app/models.py` — Added `LearnedCorrection` model
- `app/main.py` — Integrated learning into AI detection + survey submission
- `app/templates/superadmin_dashboard.html` — Added feedback display + learning link

### Distance Pricing — Now Calculated from Coordinates

**Problem:** Distance was hardcoded to £120 regardless of actual distance. The `base_distance_km` and `price_per_km` fields existed in the database but were never used.

**Solution:**
- Distance now calculated using Haversine formula from pickup/dropoff lat/lng coordinates
- Admin pricing page has new "Distance Pricing" section with configurable base distance (km) and price per km
- Quote breakdown shows actual miles calculated
- Job review shows distance in the route section

### Approval Flow Fixed

**Problem:** Auto-approval triggered during quote preview (when customer was still browsing), causing jobs to show as "Approved" in the dashboard before the customer even submitted. No manual approval step.

**Solution:**
- Removed auto-approval logic from `calculate_quote()` — all quotes now require manual admin approval
- Fixed `submit-quote` endpoint to properly set status to `awaiting_approval` and track `submitted_at`
- Updated `quote_preview.html` to show correct states:
  - `in_progress` → "Submit for review" button
  - `awaiting_approval` → "Awaiting approval" message with orange styling
  - `approved` → "Accept This Quote" button with green styling

### Property Type Auto-Submit

**Problem:** After selecting property type (House, Flat, etc.), customer had to tap a separate "Continue to Rooms" button — unnecessary friction.

**Solution:** Property type tiles now auto-submit on tap. Select House → immediately goes to rooms selection. Cleaner, faster flow.

### Files Modified

- `app/main.py` — Distance calculation, removed auto-approval, fixed submit-quote endpoint, added distance pricing to admin
- `app/templates/admin_pricing.html` — Added Distance Pricing section
- `app/templates/admin_job_review_v2.html` — Shows distance in miles
- `app/templates/quote_preview.html` — Updated status display logic
- `app/templates/property_type.html` — Auto-submit on tile tap

### Quote Price Styling

Made the quote price bigger and clearer on the customer quote preview page — solid white text at 40px with subtle green glow instead of faded gradient.

### Stripe Connect + Pay-Per-Survey Billing

**Problem:** Needed a way for:
1. Customer deposits to go directly to removal companies (not through PrimeHaul)
2. PrimeHaul to charge £9.99 per completed survey after 3 free trial surveys

**Solution — Stripe Connect for Deposits:**
- Removal companies connect their Stripe account via Dashboard → Payments
- Customer deposits transfer directly to company's bank account
- PrimeHaul never handles deposit money — clean and compliant
- New admin page at `/{slug}/admin/payments` for Connect onboarding

**Solution — Pay-Per-Survey Billing:**
- Every company gets 3 free surveys during trial
- When customer clicks "Submit for review", survey is counted
- After 3 free surveys, £9.99 charged to company's payment method
- Usage tracking displayed in Payments settings page

### Database Migration

| Migration | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| `fix005_stripe_connect_and_usage.py` | Add `stripe_connect_account_id`, `surveys_used`, `free_surveys_remaining` to companies |

### Files Created/Modified

- `app/templates/admin_payments.html` — **New**: Payment settings with Connect onboarding + usage stats
- `app/billing.py` — Added Stripe Connect functions + survey charging logic
- `app/main.py` — New endpoints for Connect onboarding, deposit payments, survey charging
- `app/models.py` — Added Connect + usage tracking fields to Company model
- `app/templates/admin_dashboard_v2.html` — Added Payments nav link
- `app/static/app.css` — Quote price styling fix

### Customer Contact Flow Restored

**Problem:** The customer contact details page (name, email, phone) was missing from the survey flow. The `/submit-quote` endpoint was changing status directly without collecting contact info first.

**Solution:**
- Split submission into two steps: contact collection → actual submission
- `/submit-quote` now redirects to `/contact` if customer details are missing
- New `/do-submit` endpoint handles the actual submission (status change, survey fee, analytics)
- `/submit-contact` saves details then redirects to `/do-submit`
- Better customer name tracking in logs and analytics events

### UX Cleanup — Strip Bloat from Survey and Dashboard

**Goal:** Make the app super easy for both customers and removal company admins. Remove verbose text, redundant UI, and distracting elements while keeping all the power under the hood.

**Customer Survey Changes:**
| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| Long subtitles with explanations | Short, action-focused text |
| Dead voice input code (40+ lines) | Removed |
| Packing service always visible with glow animation | Collapsed `<details>` section |
| Verbose T&Cs section | Compact single-line link |
| Hints and pro tips on every page | Removed — UI is self-explanatory |

**Admin Dashboard Changes:**
| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| 5-step onboarding banner (55 lines) | 3-line compact welcome |
| "Today's Summary" stats section | Removed (redundant) |
| Keyboard shortcuts hint | Removed |
| Full pricing breakdown in job review | Collapsible `<details>` section |
| T&Cs with IP, version, timestamp | Compact badge: "✓ T&Cs accepted" |

**Files Modified:**
- `start_v2.html` — Simplified text, removed dead voice code
- `room_scan.html` — Cleaner instructions
- `rooms_pick.html` — Removed duplicate code, shorter text
- `quote_preview.html` — Collapsed packing service
- `customer_contact.html` — Removed redundant hints
- `admin_dashboard_v2.html` — Major declutter (-300 lines)
- `admin_job_review_v2.html` — Collapsible breakdown, compact badges

**Result:** 326 lines of template bloat removed. Cleaner, faster UX.

### Color Scheme Update

**Problem:** Orange colors for "pending" and "awaiting approval" states looked too aggressive and pushy.

**Solution:** Replaced all orange (`#ffa500`) with soft blue (`#60a5fa`) across 11 templates and CSS. Calmer, more professional look.

### Partner Accounts

**Purpose:** Ricky (business partner with real-world infrastructure - trucks, manpower) needs unlimited free surveys for his own removal business.

**Implementation:**
- Added `is_partner` and `partner_name` fields to Company model
- Partners skip all billing — unlimited surveys forever
- Can mark any company as partner via superadmin dashboard

### Superadmin Dashboard

**URL:** `/superadmin` (password protected via `SUPERADMIN_PASSWORD` env var)

**Features:**
- All companies with status, surveys used, partner badges
- Key metrics: companies, surveys, items detected, ML corrections, revenue
- ML training data stats (photos, items, corrections, variant changes)
- Database stats (jobs, rooms, photos, items, feedback, analytics)
- Recent activity feed with timestamps
- Server status indicator
- Make any company a partner

**Files Created:**
- `app/templates/superadmin_dashboard.html`
- `app/templates/superadmin_login.html`
- `alembic/versions/fix006_partner_accounts.py`

### Legal Pages — Terms of Service & Privacy Policy

**Purpose:** Platform needs proper legal documentation for UK GDPR compliance and user accountability.

**Created:**
- `app/templates/legal_terms.html` — Terms of Service covering:
  - Service description, account registration, billing model
  - Pay-per-survey (£9.99) and partner accounts explained
  - Acceptable use, customer data responsibilities
  - AI-generated quote disclaimers

  - Contact: privacy@primehaul.co.uk

**Signup Flow:**
- Added T&Cs acceptance checkbox to `auth_signup.html`
- Users must agree to Terms of Service and Privacy Policy before creating account
- Links open in new tab for easy review
- JavaScript validation ensures checkbox is ticked

**Routes:**
- `/terms` — Serves Terms of Service page

## Session Log: 4 February 2026 (Evening)

### Glowing Packing Service CTA

**Problem:** The "Need help packing?" upsell was hidden in a collapsed `<details>` dropdown — customers almost certainly never saw it.

**Solution:** Replaced with an always-visible card with a green glowing pulse animation (`@keyframes glowPulse`). Room checkboxes have green accents when selected. Clear "This is optional" note at the bottom.

### Admin Company Details Settings

**Problem:** Company name, email, and phone were set at signup and could never be changed.

**Solution:** New admin settings page at `/{slug}/admin/company-details` with:
- Editable company name, email, phone fields
- Email format validation and uniqueness check
- Phone format validation
- Slug shown as read-only (used in customer URLs)
- Navigation link added to admin dashboard

### Furniture Size/Variant Toggle

**Problem:** AI detects "3-seater sofa" but the customer has a 2-seater. They could only delete or +1, never correct the size. Lost ML training signal.

**Solution:** Compact dropdown appears below furniture items in room scan, covering 15 categories:
- Sofas (2/3/4-seater, corner, sofa bed, leather)
- Wardrobes (single/double/triple)
- Beds (single/double/king/super king)
- Dining tables (2/4/6/8-seater)
- Mattresses, desks, chests of drawers, bookcases, TVs, fridges, washing machines, armchairs, dining chairs, sideboards, TV stands

Each variant has pre-set dimensions (length, width, height, weight, CBM). Corrections saved as `ItemFeedback` records for ML training. Original AI detection preserved in item notes.

### Bug Fix: Room Scan JS Scoping

**Problem:** `showToast`, `renderItems`, `escapeHtml` were defined inside an IIFE but called from `incrementItem`/`deleteItem` outside it — the +1 and delete buttons were silently broken.

**Fix:** Moved shared functions to top-level script scope. Added `renderItems(currentItems)` call on page load so server-rendered items get interactive buttons.

### Files Modified

- `app/variants.py` — **New**: 15 furniture categories with variant dimensions
- `app/templates/admin_company_details.html` — **New**: Company details settings page
- `app/main.py` — 3 new endpoints (company details GET/POST, variant update POST), modified room_scan_get
- `app/templates/quote_preview.html` — Replaced hidden packing dropdown with glowing CTA card
- `app/static/app.css` — Added `glowPulse` keyframe animation
- `app/templates/room_scan.html` — Variant dropdown, JS scope fix, client-side variant lookup
- `app/templates/admin_dashboard_v2.html` — Added "Company Details" nav link

### HTTPS Security Fix

**Problem:** Multiple hardcoded `http://192.168.0.139:8000` URLs in SMS booking links sent to customers. Auth cookies set to `secure=False`. Stripe redirect URLs defaulted to `http://localhost`. No proxy header trust for Railway's SSL termination.

**Fixes:**

| Fix | Details |
|-----|---------|
| Booking SMS links | Replaced 2x hardcoded local IP with `RAILWAY_PUBLIC_DOMAIN` env var |
| Stripe redirects | Changed `APP_URL` default from `http://localhost` to `https://primehaul.co.uk` |
| Auth cookies | `secure=False` → `secure=True` (2 spots: login + signup) |
| Proxy headers | Added `ProxyHeadersMiddleware` to trust Railway's `X-Forwarded-Proto` |

**Note:** Ensure `RAILWAY_PUBLIC_DOMAIN` is set to `primehaul.co.uk` in Railway env vars.

### Landing Page — Cost Comparison Section

Added a "Do The Maths" section between the stats and pricing sections on the landing page. Side-by-side red vs green cards showing:
- **Without primehaul**: 3 site visits × £75 = £225 to win one job
- **With primehaul**: £9.99 per survey, AI instant quote, approve in 30 secs

Bold headline: **"That's a 95% cost reduction on quoting"**. Responsive — stacks on mobile.

## Session Log: 4 February 2026 (Morning)

### Bulky Item Weight Threshold Fix

**Problem:** Dining tables, chairs, and other moderate furniture were unfairly charged a £25/item bulky surcharge based on being furniture, not weight. A dining set (1 table + 6 chairs) could add £175 in bulky fees even though none of the items exceed 50kg.

**Solution:** Changed bulky classification from a manual/AI boolean flag to a weight-based threshold (default 50kg). Items are only "bulky" for pricing purposes if they weigh over the configurable threshold.

| Change | Details |
|--------|---------|
| New config field | `bulky_weight_threshold_kg` added to PricingConfig (default 50kg) |
| Quote calculation | Now counts bulky items by `weight_kg > threshold` instead of boolean flag |
| AI vision prompt | Updated to guide weight-based bulky estimation (>50kg) |
| Item creation | 3 endpoints now set `bulky` flag by weight instead of trusting AI boolean |
| Admin pricing page | New "Bulky Weight Threshold (kg)" field added |
| Marketplace pricing | Auto-bid and bid form now query items by weight instead of inventory_summary |
| Furniture catalog | 20 items under 50kg changed from bulky to non-bulky |

### Database Migration

| Migration | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| `fix004_bulky_weight_threshold.py` | Add `bulky_weight_threshold_kg` column to `pricing_configs` (default 50) |

### Files Modified

- `app/models.py` — Added `bulky_weight_threshold_kg` column
- `app/main.py` — Quote calculation, 3 item creation spots, update_pricing endpoint, marketplace bid form
- `app/ai_vision.py` — Updated AI prompt for weight-based bulky guidance
- `app/marketplace.py` — Updated auto_generate_bid to count by weight
- `app/templates/admin_pricing.html` — Added threshold input field
- `populate_furniture_catalog.py` — Updated is_bulky flags for 20 items
- `alembic/versions/fix004_bulky_weight_threshold.py` — New migration

### Commits
