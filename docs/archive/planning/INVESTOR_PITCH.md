# 🚀 PrimeHaul: The AI-Powered Removals Marketplace

**"Uber for Removals" - Built with 2025 AI Technology**

---

## 💰 THE OPPORTUNITY

**UK Removals Market:** £1.4 billion/year
**Annual House Moves:** 800,000+
**Current Technology:** Stuck in 2010 (AnyVan, Shiply use outdated desktop-first platforms)
**Our Advantage:** AI-powered, mobile-first, 6x faster than competitors

**We're not just building a better removals platform. We're creating the first AI-powered marketplace that makes moving house effortless.**

---

## ❌ THE PROBLEM (Why This Market Needs Disruption)

**For Customers Moving House:**
- Call 5-10 removal companies individually (takes 2+ days)
- Spend 30-45 minutes per company describing their belongings
- Get wildly inconsistent quotes (companies guessing volume)
- No transparency on pricing
- Desktop-first websites (painful on mobile)

**For Removal Companies:**
- Spend hours on phone calls getting job details
- Drive to customer's house for accurate quote (wasted time)
- Miss jobs because customers found someone faster
- Pay £200+/month for outdated lead generation platforms
- No tools to help them quote accurately

**Industry Pain Point:** Moving house is one of the most stressful life events, yet the technology supporting it hasn't changed in 15 years.

---

## ✅ THE SOLUTION (What We've Built)

### **PrimeHaul: Two Products, One Platform**

**1️⃣ B2B SaaS: AI Quote Tool** (£99/month subscription)
- Removal companies get their own branded quote survey
- Customers take photos with their phone (5 minutes!)
- AI analyzes photos and counts everything automatically
- Company gets accurate inventory + volume calculation
- Beautiful branded quote sent to customer
- **Value Prop:** Turn 45-minute manual quotes into 5-minute automated experiences

**2️⃣ Marketplace: Job Bidding Platform** (15% commission on jobs)
- Customers submit moving job once via AI survey
- We broadcast to 5-10 nearby removal companies
- Companies bid competitively (best price wins)
- Customer chooses winner with one click
- We charge 15% commission on completed jobs
- **Value Prop:** Customers save time + money, companies get qualified leads
