## 🚀 WHAT IS PRIMEHAUL?

**The Simple Version:**
PrimeHaul is "Uber for Removals" - customers submit their moving job once, removal companies compete with quotes, customer picks the best price. We take 15% commission.

**Why It's Needed:**
- Right now: Customers call 5-10 companies individually (takes 2+ days)
- With PrimeHaul: Customer takes photos with phone (5 minutes), gets 3-5 quotes in 24 hours
- AI analyzes photos → companies get accurate inventory → better quotes
- Everyone wins: customers save time + money, companies get leads without marketing

**The Opportunity:**
- UK removals market: £1.4 billion/year
- 800,000+ house moves per year
- Current leaders (AnyVan, Shiply) use 2010s technology
- We're using 2025 AI-powered technology
- We're 6x faster and mobile-first (they're desktop-first)

**Revenue Model:**
1. **Marketplace:** 15% commission on every job (e.g., £800 job = £120 for us)
2. **B2B SaaS:** Removal companies pay £99/month for AI quote tool

**Current Status:**
- ✅ Platform built (6 months of development)
- ✅ Database ready
- ✅ AI working
- ✅ Email system ready
- 🔴 Need to fix 3-4 technical issues (3 hours work)
- 🚀 Ready to launch THIS WEEK

## 🎯 YOUR ROLE: Growth & Customer Success Partner

**What You'll Do (The Fun Stuff!):**

### **Phase 1: Launch Week (This Week)**
- Help test the AI survey platform (use it yourself, find bugs)
- Get your friends/family to submit 5 test jobs via AI survey
- Create social media accounts (Instagram, TikTok, Facebook)
- Write first 10 social media posts (I'll help with ideas)
- Design simple graphics (use Canva - I'll teach you)

### **Phase 2: First 5-10 Customers (Weeks 2-3)**
- Post daily on social media to drive people to AI survey (15 min/day)
- When customers submit via AI survey, manually get them quotes:
  - Call 5-10 removal companies per job
  - Collect quotes and send to customer
  - Connect customer with winning company (2-3 hours per job)
- Track what works and what needs fixing

### **Phase 3: Onboard Companies to Platform (Week 3)**
- Call companies you worked with: "Want to join platform for more jobs?"
- Get 5-10 companies signed up
- Test first automated job (customer → AI survey → auto-broadcast → bids → acceptance)

### **Phase 4: Growth Mode (Week 4+)**
- Platform now runs automatically!
- You focus on: social media, customer support, recruiting more companies
- Monitor dashboard, answer questions (1-2 hours/day)

### **Phase 3: Growth Mode (Month 2+)**
- Manage customer support (answer questions, resolve issues)
- Run Google Ads campaigns (I'll set up, you monitor)
- Create content: blog posts, TikTok videos, Instagram reels
- Build community: Facebook group for customers, WhatsApp for companies
- Partner with estate agents (cross-promotion)

**What You WON'T Do:**
- ❌ Any coding or technical setup (that's my job)
- ❌ Fix bugs or deploy servers (that's my job)
- ❌ Handle billing/accounting initially (we'll hire later)

**Time Commitment:**
- **Week 1:** 20 hours (launch prep + testing)
- **Weeks 2-4:** 15 hours/week (growth activities)
- **Month 2+:** 20-25 hours/week (can go full-time once profitable)

**Skills You Already Have That Are PERFECT:**
- 💬 **People skills** → customer support will be amazing
- 📱 **Social media savvy** → you know Instagram/TikTok better than me
- ✍️ **Writing** → emails, posts, content creation
- 🎯 **Empathy** → you understand customer pain points

## 💰 PARTNERSHIP TERMS

I'm offering you **3 options** - pick whichever feels right:

### **Option 1: Equity Partner (Recommended)**
- **15% equity** in PrimeHaul Ltd
- No salary initially
- Equal decision-making on growth strategy
- Once profitable (£5k/month revenue), take £1,500/month salary
- After that, split profits: 85% me, 15% you

**Example earnings:**
- Month 6: £1,500/month salary (£18k/year)
- Year 1: £1,500 salary + £4,500 profit share = £72k/year
- Year 2: £2,500 salary + £15,000 profit share = £210k/year

**If we sell the company:**
- Sell for £1M → you get £150k
- Sell for £5M → you get £750k
- Sell for £10M → you get £1.5M

### **Option 2: Revenue Share (Lower Risk)**
- **20% revenue share** (not equity)
- No ownership of company
- Guaranteed percentage of every £1 we make
- Can walk away anytime (keep all money earned so far)
- No upside if we sell company

**Example earnings:**
- Month 3: £3,000 revenue × 20% = £600
- Month 6: £10,000 revenue × 20% = £2,000
- Year 1: £50,000 revenue × 20% = £10,000/year
- Year 2: £200,000 revenue × 20% = £40,000/year

### **Option 3: Hybrid (Best of Both Worlds)**
- **10% equity** in company
- **10% revenue share** until profitable
- Once profitable (£5k/month), switch to £1,200/month salary
- Keep the 10% equity forever

**Example earnings:**
- Month 1-3: 10% of revenue (£300-600/month)
- Month 4+: £1,200/month salary
- Year 2: £1,800/month salary
- If we sell for £5M → you get £500k

## ❓ FAQ (Questions You Might Have)

**Q: I'm not technical - can I really do this?**

**Q: What if it doesn't work?**
A: Worst case: You've learned digital marketing, social media growth, startup operations, and made some money. These skills are HUGELY valuable. Best case: We build a £5M+ business and you've changed your life.

**Q: How much time do I need to commit?**
A: Week 1: 20 hours. Weeks 2-4: 15 hours/week. Month 2+: 20-25 hours/week. Eventually, you can go full-time (40 hours/week with £2,500+ salary) once we're profitable.

A: NOT YET! Start part-time (15-20 hours/week). Once we hit £10k/month revenue, you can go full-time if you want. I'll never ask you to take a risk you're not comfortable with.

**Q: What if we disagree on something?**
A: We talk it out! I have final say on technical stuff, you have final say on customer/marketing stuff. For big decisions (pricing, hiring, selling company), we decide together. If we can't agree, we get a third opinion (mentor, advisor).

**Q: Can I bring in other people to help?**
A: Yes! If you want to hire a VA, social media manager, or content creator later, we'll budget for it once profitable. You can manage them.

**Q: What happens if I need to leave?**
A: In first month: You keep any money earned, walk away freely. After first month: We negotiate a fair buyout of your equity (if you have equity). You'll never be trapped or forced to stay!

## 💭 A PERSONAL NOTE FROM ME

Partner,

I trust you 100%. That's not something I say lightly.

I've been working on this alone for 6 months. It's lonely. I need someone who cares about the customers as much as the code. Someone who can talk to real people and make them feel heard.

That's you.


I handle the technical stuff (that's my strength). You handle the human stuff (that's yours).

Together, we can build something really special.

This isn't just about money (though that'll be great too!). It's about building something we're proud of. Something that actually helps people.

I think we can do this. I hope you do too.

Let me know what you think. No pressure - just honest conversation.

Thanks for considering this.

🚀 Let's build something amazing together.
