Moving soon? Here's a tip! 💡

I just helped my sister move from Bristol to Leeds and we used PrimeHaul to get quotes.

Instead of spending hours calling companies, she just:
1. Took photos of her rooms (5 min)
2. Got 4 quotes the next day
3. Saved £180 by comparing!

It's completely free for customers. Just thought I'd share since I see lots of people asking about removals here!

Anyone else used something like this before?

## 💬 WHATSAPP / LIVE CHAT RESPONSES

### **Quick Replies (Save these in WhatsApp Business)**

**"How much does it cost?"**
```
Great question! PrimeHaul is 100% FREE for customers.

You just pay the removal company you choose (after comparing all the quotes).

No hidden fees from us! 😊
```

**"How long does it take?"**
```
Super quick!

Survey: 5 minutes (just take photos)
Quotes: 24 hours (usually faster!)
Comparing quotes: 2 minutes
Booking: 1 minute

Total time investment: About 10 minutes! ⏱️
```

**"Is it really free?"**
```
Yes! 100% free for customers.

No credit card needed.
No hidden fees.
No catch!

We charge a small commission to the removal company (they're happy to pay because they get more customers).

You just pay the company you choose - nothing extra! 💯
```

**"What if I don't like any quotes?"**
```
No worries at all!

You're never obligated to accept any quote.

If the prices are too high or you change your mind, just say no thanks. Zero pressure! 😊

Want to try another search with different details? We can help with that too!
```

**"Do I have to type everything?"**
```
Nope! That's the best part! 📸

Just take photos with your phone.

Our AI counts boxes, furniture, and everything else.

No typing. No measuring. No stressing!

It's honestly the easiest part of moving! 😄
```

**"When will I get quotes?"**
```
Usually within 24 hours!

Sometimes you'll get the first quote in just a few hours.

```
No problem! I'm here to help!

## 📞 PHONE SCRIPT (For Calling Companies)

**Opening:**
```
"Hi! Is this [Company Name]?"
[Wait]
"Great! My name's Partner and I'm calling from PrimeHaul. Have you got 2 minutes?"
[Wait]
"Brilliant! Quick question - are you looking for more removal jobs right now?"
```

**Pitch:**
```
"We're a new marketplace connecting customers with removal companies.

Basically, customers submit their job to us, and we send it to companies like yours. You bid on the jobs you want, customer picks the best quote, and you get their contact details.

No upfront costs - just 15% commission when you win a job.

We've got 50+ customers ready to submit jobs this month.

Sound interesting?"
```

**Handling Objections:**

**"15% is too high"**
```
"I totally get it! But think of it this way - you're getting customers you wouldn't have found otherwise. No marketing costs, no wasted time chasing leads. Just warm leads ready to book.

Most companies find they make MORE money overall because they're not spending time and money on marketing!"
```

**"We're too busy right now"**
```
"Perfect! That's exactly when you should join. You can decline any jobs that don't fit your schedule. Think of it as a pipeline for when things slow down - and they always do eventually, right?"
```

**"Let me think about it"**
```
"Absolutely! Tell you what - I'll email you the details so you can review them properly. What's your email?

[Get email]

Perfect! I'll send that over now. If you have questions, just reply to the email or call me back!

Also - just FYI, we're capping at 50 companies per region, so don't wait too long! 😊"
