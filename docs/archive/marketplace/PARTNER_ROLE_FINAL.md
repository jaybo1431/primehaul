## 🔄 YOUR JOB (What Happens After Customer Submits)

### **PHASE 1: Manual Concierge (Week 1-3)**

You call 5-10 companies:
"Hi! I'm Partner from PrimeHaul. I have a customer moving
London to Manchester next Thursday. 2-bed flat, 8.4 cubic meters.

AI-analyzed inventory with photos available. Ready to book this week.

```

**Step 7: You follow up**
```
Next week, text Sarah:

```
