## 🎯 YOUR ROLE IN 3 SENTENCES

1. **You bring customers** to our AI survey (social media, ads, partnerships)
2. **You help customers get quotes** (manual at first, automated later via platform)
3. **You build relationships with companies** (so they join our platform)

That's it! Simple, but SUPER important! 💪

**IMPORTANT:** The AI survey is AUTOMATED - customers take photos, AI analyzes. Your job is getting customers to USE it, then helping them get quotes from companies!

## 🤔 COMMON QUESTIONS

**"I'm not technical - can I do this?"**
YES! That's exactly why @primehaul needs you. The technical stuff is handled. You need to be brilliant with people. And you are! 😊

**"What if it doesn't work?"**
Worst case: You learn digital marketing, social media, startup skills + make some money. Best case: Life-changing success! Either way, you win.

**"Do I have to quit my job?"**
NOT YET! Start part-time (15-20 hrs/week). Once we hit £10k/month revenue, you can go full-time if you want.

**"What if we disagree on something?"**
You own growth/marketing, @primehaul owns technical. Big decisions (pricing, hiring, selling) are decided together. Simple!
